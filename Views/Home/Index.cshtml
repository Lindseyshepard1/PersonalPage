                <p>  Hello, world! My name is Lindsey Shepard, and this is my personal page.  On July 1, 2019 I began a new chapter of my life by participating in Microsoft’s Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) for Cloud Development. This was exciting and scary at the same time because I never walked down the road of software development. In January of 2019 I transitioned out of the United States Marine Corps, on the brink of college courses, deciding what path I wanted to take my career. I came across this opportunity, MSSA, and my life changed. I have been faced with the challenges of the IT world; however, I have never been happier. Time flies when you’re having fun!
    <br>    This page will touch on a little about me as a person. I have included linked into my accomplishments as well. What I learned while in MSSA, personal projects, class projects. I also included my resume on another tab. Anyone who does come across this page I would love to hear from you. I am still learning, and trying to build on what I know, any recommendations for projects or even this web site please feel free to reach out! I would love to hear from people who also love this field!
