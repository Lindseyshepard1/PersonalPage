                            Hello, world! My name is Lindsey Shepard, and this is my personal page.  On July 1, 2019 I began a new chapter<br />
                            of my life by participating in Microsoft’s Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) for Cloud Development. This was<br />
                            exciting and scary at the same time because I never walked down the road of software development. In January of <br />
                            2019 I transitioned out of the United States Marine Corps, on the brink of college courses, deciding what path I<br />
                            wanted to take my career. I came across this opportunity, MSSA, and my life changed. I have been faced with the<br />
                            challenges of the IT world; however, I have never been happier. Time flies when you’re having fun!
                            <br>
                            Innovation. A word that is passed around a lot in the IT industry. What exactly is it? It is as straight <br />

                            forward as the definition provides? the action or process of innovating, a new method, idea, <br />

                            product, etc. There are new ideas every day, new conversations in so many aspect of life that it <br />

                            cannot be limited to what we find with data. And it’s not. That is the beauty of it. Technology is not
                            <br />
                            limited to the IT industry. There is a form of innovation at every corner, medical achievements,
                            <br />
                            mentally. New ideas are being cast in retail, aviation’s, how I order my coffee. I have been asked
                            <br />
                            Why Tech? Why did you decide on this industry verse all the others. The reasons behind may get
                            <br />
                            complicated, but my answer is simple. I want to be a part of an industry that’s passion and intent is
                            <br />
                            to better the lives of everybody. If I can save the soccer mom an extra 5 minutes in the morning – I

                            <br />
                            would collaborate and create an application, if I can help brainstorm software that can be adopted
                            <br />
                            into a medical facility to help the staff  complete their jobs then I succeeded. Why tech wasn’t a
                            <br />
                            question to make me think why do I want to do this. This question made me think where do I want
                            <br />
                            to start and what company has the same values in taking care of the world. <br />
                            These ideas are ambitious for someone so new to the industry, but my fire for learning more has
                            <br />
                            never been so driving for me and I am absolutely addicted to the passion. I believe it is possible to
                            <br />
                            have an impact. I believe in such a fast-paced and developing industry everybody can add their own
                            <br />
                            personal innovation. I want to be surrounded by the people that ooze optimism as much as I do.
