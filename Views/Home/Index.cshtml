    Hello, world! My name is Lindsey Shepard, and this is my personal page. On July 1, 2019 I began a new chapter of my life by participating in Microsoft’s Software and Systems Academy (MSSA)
    for Cloud Development. This was exciting and scary at the same time because I never walked down the road of software development. In January of 2019 I transitioned out of the United States
    Marine Corps, on the brink of college courses, deciding what path I wanted to take my career. I came across this opportunity, MSSA, and my life changed. I have been faced with the challenges
    of the IT world; however, I have never been happier. Time flies when you’re having fun! Innovation. A word that is passed around a lot in the IT industry. What exactly is it? It is as 
    straight forward as the definition provides? the action or process of innovating, a new method, idea, product, etc. There are new ideas every day, new conversations in so many aspects of 
    life that it cannot be limited to what we discover with data. And it’s not. That is the beauty of it. Technology is not limited to the IT industry. There is a form of innovation at every
    corner, medical achievements, mentally. New ideas are being cast in retail, aviation’s, how I order my coffee. I have been asked Why Tech? Why did you decide on this industry? The reasons 
    behind may get complicated but my answer is simple. I want to be a part of an industry whose passion and intent is to better the lives of everybody. If I can save the soccer mom an extra
    five minutes in the morning – I would collaborate and create an application, if I can help brainstorm software that can be adopted into a medical facility to help the staff complete their
    jobs then I succeeded. Why tech wasn’t a question to make me think why I want to do this. This question made me think where I want to start and what company has the same values in taking 
    care of the world. These ideas are ambitious for someone so new to the industry, but my fire for learning more has never been so driving for me and I am absolutely addicted to the passion.
    I believe it is possible to have an impact. I believe in such a fast-paced and developing industry everybody can add their own personal innovation. I want to be surrounded by the people 
    that ooze optimism as much as I do.
